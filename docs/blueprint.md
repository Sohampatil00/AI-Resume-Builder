## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#293B5F), symbolizing trust and professionalism, but also approachability. It is easy to read text displayed on this background.
- Background color: Light gray (#E9F0F5) offers a clean, modern, and professional feel.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#6A8E82) to provide a touch of sophistication and visual interest. Used sparingly for interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for the main body of the application. 'Inter' is highly legible and provides a modern feel.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. A modern font choice with a slight techy edge, which still presents a highly readable, modern form. Use 'Space Grotesk' for headlines and 'Inter' for body text.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different sections of the resume (education, experience, etc.).
- Clean and well-organized layout with clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance user experience (e.g., on hover or click).
